# API Curation (alpha)

This topic describes how you can use API Curation to expose several standalone APIs as one API for API Auto Registration.

> **Caution** The API Curation feature is in alpha and is intended for evaluation and test purposes
> only. Do not use in a production environment.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview 

To unlock the maximum power of API curation, VMware recommends using a supported route provider.
Without this setup, the generated API specifications do not have a functional server URL set for testing the
curated API. You must manually create the routing resources to route traffic to each
referenced API to match with the aggregated API specifications. With the route provider integration, these
routing concerns is taken care of automatically.

A successful API curation requires the following:

1. (Optional) Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes is installed.
1. (Optional) `SpringCloudGateway` resources created with the matching `groupId` and `version`.
1. API Auto Registration installed or updated with `route_provider.spring_cloud_gateway.enabled` set.
1. One or more `APIDescriptor`s in the ready state.
1. A `CuratedAPIDescriptor` resource is created.
1. You can get the aggregated API specifications from the OpenAPI endpoint from our controller.

## <a id='create-route-provider'></a>(Optional) Install route provider and create gateway resources

You can optionally install a route provider and create gateway resources.

### <a id='setup-scg'></a>Setup Spring Cloud Gateway integration

Install Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes (SCG). See [Install Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes](../spring-cloud-gateway/install-spring-cloud-gateway.hbs.md).

SCG integration as route provider is deactivated by default. After you have SCG installed, you can enable
SCG as a route provider by [installing/updating API Auto Registration](./configuration.hbs.md) with
the following value property:

```yaml
route_provider:
  spring_cloud_gateway:
    enabled: true
    scg_openapi_service_url: "http://scg-openapi-service.spring-cloud-gateway.svc.cluster.local" # default value
```

For SCG v2.1.0 and later, if you enabled TLS on SCG, or installed it in a custom namespace,
you must overwrite `route_provider.spring_cloud_gateway.scg_openapi_service_url` in your
API Auto Registration values file.

If you are using earlier version of SCG, consider upgrading or see the following table to
understand the impact:

| Capability with SCG v2.1.0 and later | Behavior before SCG v2.1.0 |
| --- | --- |
| The default value `scg_openapi_service_url` is sufficient if using the default SCG installation. | You must overwrite the value `scg_openapi_service_url` with `http://scg-operator.tap-install.svc.cluster.local` if using the default SCG installation. |
| Matching SCG updates API metadata automatically and the generated OpenAPI specifications reflect the metadata. | API metadata annotations are added or updated, but the API specifications exposed from SCG OpenAPI endpoint do not reflect that. |
| The aggregated API specifications are in sync with the SCG generated API specifications. | SCG OpenAPI endpoint does not support returning specifications for a single SCG instance, so the aggregated API specifications do not include the additional information from SCG filters. |

### <a id='create-scg'></a>Create SpringCloudGateway resource

You can create, using GitOps or manually, an `SpringCloudGateway` CR and apply it in the
cluster you choose.

The following is an example SCG resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: "tanzu.vmware.com/v1"
kind: SpringCloudGateway
metadata:
  name: test-api-curation
spec:
  api:
    version: 1.2.3
    groupId: test-api-curation
    serverUrl: https://my-curated-api.mydomain.com
    cors:
      allowedOrigins:
        - "http://api-portal.mydomain.com"
      allowedMethods:
        - "GET"
        - "PUT"
        - "POST"
      allowedHeaders:
        - '*'
```

The `groupId` and `version` matches on the SCG when VMware reconciles for `CuratedAPIDescriptor`.
After finding a match, `serverUrl` is used as the baseURL of the curated API.

## <a id='create-api-descriptors-curation'></a>Create APIDescriptors for curation

To create `APIDescriptor` resources, see [API Auto Registration Usage Guide](./usage.hbs.md).
If any of the referenced `APIDescriptor` are not ready, the `CuratedAPIDescriptor` keeps retrying
until all the referenced `APIDescriptor`s are ready. If the API specifications from any of the `APIDescriptor`
update, our controller picks up the changes on the next reconciliation loop.

**Note** By default, the update might take up to 10 minutes, including
maximum 5 minutes to refresh the `APIDescriptor`, and maximum 5 minutes to refresh `CuratedAPIDescriptor`.
You can shorten the wait time by configuring `sync_period` in the AAR values file.

## <a id='create-curated-api-descriptor'></a>Create CuratedAPIDescriptor custom resource

Using your GitOps process, or manually, you can create an CuratedAPIDescriptor CR and apply it in the
cluster you choose. Specify all the required fields for an CuratedAPIDescriptor CR to reconcile.

For information about CuratedAPIDescriptors, see [CuratedAPIDescriptor explained](./key-concepts.hbs.md#curated-api-descriptor).

## <a id='retrieve-curated-api-specs'></a>Retrieve curated API specifications

The API Auto Registration controller offers an endpoint to retrieve all the generated API specifications for
the curated APIs in the cluster. To do so, you must first find the HTTPProxy that's created for
accessing the endpoint:

```console
kubectl get httpproxy api-auto-registration-controller -n api-auto-registration
```

The result is similar to:

```console
NAME                               FQDN                              TLS SECRET                   STATUS   STATUS DESCRIPTION
api-auto-registration-controller   api-auto-registration.tap.domain  api-auto-registration-cert   valid    Valid HTTPProxy
```

With the FQDN with proper http scheme, you can get all the curated API specifications with curl:

```console
curl http(s)://AAR-CONTROLLER-FQDN/openapi
```

Where `AAR-CONTROLLER-FQDN` is the AAR FQDN controller you want the specifications for.

You can retrieve specifications for a specific `groupId` and `version` combination by specifying query parameters:

```console
curl http(s)://AAR-CONTROLLER-FQDN/openapi?groupId=GROUP-ID&version=VERSION
```

Where:

- `VERSION` is the version you want the specifications for.
- `GROUP-ID` is group ID you want the specifications for.
- `AAR-CONTROLLER-FQDN` is the AAR-CONTROLLER-FQDN you want to query.

You can add the curated APIs to an API portal for display by configuring the source URL
locations of an existing API portal.
You can add all your curated APIs by using the unfiltered URL `http(s)://AAR-CONTROLLER-FQDN/openapi`
or the filtered URL with query parameters to add a specific curated API of your choice.
