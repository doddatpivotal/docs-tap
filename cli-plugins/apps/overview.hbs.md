# Tanzu Apps CLI overview

This topic gives you an overview of the Tanzu Apps CLI. Use the Tanzu Apps CLI to create, view,
update, and delete application workloads on any Kubernetes cluster that has the Tanzu Application
Platform (commonly known as TAP) components installed.

## <a id='about'></a>About workloads

Tanzu Application Platform enables you to quickly build and test applications regardless of
your familiarity with Kubernetes. You can turn source code into a workload that runs in a container
with a URL. A workload enables you to choose application specifications, such as repository location,
environment variables, and service binding.

Tanzu Application Platform can support a range of workloads, including a serverless process that
starts on demand, a constellation of microservices that functions as a logical application, or
a small hello-world test application.

For information about installing the Tanzu Apps CLI, see [Install Tanzu Apps CLI](./getting-started/installation.hbs.md).
