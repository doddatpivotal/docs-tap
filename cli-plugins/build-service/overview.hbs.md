# Build Service CLI plug-in overview

This topic tells you how to use the Build Service CLI plug-in to view all the Tanzu Build Service
resources on any Kubernetes cluster that has Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP) or
Tanzu Build Service (commonly known as TBS) installed.

For information about all available commands, see [Command Reference](command-reference/tanzu_build-service.hbs.md).

### <a id='image-command'></a>Image Command

Use the `image` command to interact with the kpack image resource that is created by the supply
