# tanzu insight triage update

This topic tells you how to use the Tanzu Insight CLI
`tanzu insight triage update` command to create or update a vulnerability analysis.

## <a id='synopsis'></a>Synopsis

Create or update a vulnerability impact analysis. For impact analysis, you must
target a specific OS and application package, vulnerability, and image or source
belonging to a specific Artifact Group. This tool follows CycloneDX's VEX specification
for impact analysis, that includes flag options for each of the CycloneDX's
VEX fields, and support for only their predefined values. Here is a
description of the fields and their supported options:

## Impact Analysis States \-\-state

Declares the current state of an occurrence of a vulnerability, after automated
or manual analysis.

- resolved = the vulnerability is remediated.
- resolved_with_pedigree = the vulnerability is remediated and evidence of
  the changes are provided in the affected components pedigree containing
  verifiable commit history or diffs.
- exploitable = the vulnerability might be directly or indirectly exploitable.
- in_triage = the vulnerability is being investigated.
- false_positive = the vulnerability is not specific to the component or service
  and was falsely identified or associated.
- not_affected = the component or service is not affected by the vulnerability.  

## Impact Analysis Justifications \-\-justification

The rationale of why the impact analysis state was asserted is described here:

- code_not_present = the code is removed or tree-shaked.
- code_not_reachable = the vulnerable code is not invoked at runtime.
- requires_configuration = exploitability requires a configurable option to be
  set or unset.
- requires_dependency = exploitability requires a dependency that is not present.
- requires_environment = exploitability requires a certain environment that is
  not present.
- protected_by_compiler = exploitability requires a compiler flag to be
  set or unset.
- protected_at_runtime = exploits are prevented at runtime.
- protected_at_perimeter = attacks are blocked at physical, logical, or network
  perimeter.
- protected_by_mitigating_control = preventative measures have been implemented
  that reduce the likelihood or impact of the vulnerability.

> **Note** `--justification` is required when `--state` is set to `not_affected`

## Impact Analysis Responses \-\-response

A response to the vulnerability by the manufacturer, supplier, or project
responsible for the affected component or service.  More than one response is allowed. Responses are strongly encouraged for vulnerabilities where the
analysis state is exploitable

- can_not_fix
- will_not_fix
- update
- rollback
- workaround_available

> **Note** `--response` is highly encouraged when `--state` is set to `exploitable`; however, CycloneDX specification does not require this.

## Free form comments \-\-comment

Syntax:

```console
tanzu insight triage update --cveid CVE-ID --pkg-name PKG-NAME --pkg-version PKG-VERSION --img-digest DIGEST --artifact-group-uid UID [--state STATE] [--justification JUSTIFICATION] [--response RESPONSE1, RESPONSE2] [--comment COMMENT] [flags]
```
