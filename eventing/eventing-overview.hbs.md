# Eventing Overview

This topic gives you an overview of the Eventing package on TAP.

## Overview
Eventing is enterprise supported Knative Eventing.
Eventing offers everything Knative Eventing does and some extras that make it ideal for cloud native application development.
Cloud Native Runtimes gives developers a powerful default toolsuite to enable event-driven architectures with the inclusion of RabbitMQ and TriggerMesh support.

Eventing works well with these use cases:

* AI/ML
* Data replication
* Event driven and serverless application architectures
* IoT sensor data
* Parallel processing asynchronously
