# Default resources

This topic tells you about the resources that are templated in the default-resources secret for the
different installation profile and supply chain value combinations in Tanzu Application Platform
(commonly known as TAP).

Namespace Provisioner is installed as part of the standard installation profile. The default set of
resources provisioned in a namespace is based on a combination of the installation profile employed
and the supply chain that is installed on the cluster. For more information about installation
profiles, see [Installation profiles in Tanzu Application Platform](../about-package-profiles.hbs.md#profiles-and-packages)

The following table shows the list of resources that are templated in the default-resources secret
for each installation profile and supply chain value combination:

| Namespace  | Kind | Name | supply_chain | Install Profile | Reconcile |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| tap-install  | PackageInstall | grype-scanner-{ns} | testing_scanning | full, build | Yes  |
| tap-install  | Secret | grype-scanner-{ns} | testing_scanning | full, build | Yes |
| Developer Namespace  | Secret | registries-credentials | n/a | full, iterate, build, run | Yes |
| Developer Namespace  | ServiceAccount | From: ootb_supply_chain_{supply_chain}.service_account (default: "default") | n/a | full, iterate, build, run | No |
| Developer Namespace  | ServiceAccount | From: ootb_delivery_basic.service_account (default: "default") | n/a| full, iterate, run | No  |
| Developer Namespace  | RoleBinding | default-permit-deliverable | n/a | full, iterate, run | Yes  |
| Developer Namespace  | RoleBinding | default-permit-workload | n/a | full, iterate, build | Yes  |
| Developer Namespace | LimitRange | {namespace}-lr | n/a | run | Yes |
