### Symptom

Some or all workloads in the Tanzu Workloads panel only have describe and delete actions.

### Cause

By design, only associated workloads have apply, debug, and Live Update workload actions available.

### Solution

Open a project that contains a module that can be associated with your deployed workloads.
