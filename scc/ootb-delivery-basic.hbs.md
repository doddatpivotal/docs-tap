# Out of the Box Delivery Basic for Supply Chain Choreographer

This topic is an overview of the Out of the Box Delivery Basic package for Supply Chain Choreographer.

This package provides a reusable ClusterDelivery object that is responsible for
delivering to an environment the Kubernetes configuration that is
produced by the Out of the Box Supply Chains, including [Basic](ootb-supply-chain-basic.html),
[Testing](ootb-supply-chain-testing.html), and
[Testing With Scanning](ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning.html).

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

To make use of this package you must have installed:

- [Supply Chain Cartographer](../install-online/components.hbs.md#install-scc)
- [Out of the Box Templates](ootb-templates.html)

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Using Out of the Box Delivery Basic

Out of the Box Delivery Basic support both GitOps and local development workflows:

```text
GITOPS

    Deliverable:
      points at a git repository where source code is found and
      kubernetes configuration is pushed to


LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

    Deliverable:

      points at a container image registry where the supplychain
      pushes source code and configuration to


---

DELIVERY

    takes a Deliverable (local or gitops) and passes is through
    a series of resources:


           config-provider  <---[config]--- deployer
                 .                             .
                 .                             .
    GitRepository/ImageRepository         kapp-ctrl/App
                                                - knative/Service
                                                - ResourceClaim
                                                - ServiceBinding
                                                ...
```

You must install this package to have Workloads delivered properly with the
[Basic](ootb-supply-chain-basic.html),
[Testing](ootb-supply-chain-testing.html), and [Testing With
Scanning](ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning.html) Out of the Box Supply Chains.

Consumers do not interact directly with this package. Instead, this package is
used after the supply chains create a
[carto.run/Deliverable](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer) object to
express the intention of having the Workloads that go through them delivered to
an environment. The environment is the same Kubernetes cluster as the Supply
Chains.
