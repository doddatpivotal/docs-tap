# Overview of TLS and certificates in Tanzu Application Platform

This topic provides you with information about certificate requirements for ingress and egress communication in Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP).

Ingress communication uses TLS by default. Platform operators can control
certificates and how they are used by components. For more information, see
[Ingress certificates](./ingress/about.hbs.md).

For egress communication, you can establish trust for custom CA certificates.
For more information, see [Custom CA certificates](./custom-ca-certificates.hbs.md).
