# Overview of Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes

Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes is an API gateway solution based on the open-source
Spring Cloud Gateway project. It provides a simple means to route internal or external API requests
to application services that expose APIs.

Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes handles cross-cutting concerns on behalf of API development teams,
including single sign-on (SSO), access control, rate limiting, resiliency, security, and more.

It enables you to accelerate API delivery using modern cloud-native patterns with any programming
language you choose for API development. It also integrates with your existing CI/CD pipeline strategy.
