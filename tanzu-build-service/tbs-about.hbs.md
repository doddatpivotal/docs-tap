# Overview of Tanzu Build Service

This topic provides you with an overview of VMware Tanzu Build Service in Tanzu Application Platform
(commonly known as TAP).

## Overview

Tanzu Build Service automates container creation, management, and governance at enterprise scale.
Tanzu Build Service uses the open-source [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/)
project to turn application source code into container images.
It executes reproducible builds aligned with modern container standards and keeps images up to date.

Use the Build Service CLI plug-in to view all the Tanzu Build Service
resources on any Kubernetes cluster that has Tanzu Application Platform or Tanzu Build Service
installed. For more information, see [Build Service CLI plug-in overview](../cli-plugins/build-service/overview.hbs.md).
